# Static-Comp-3 - Todd Ayres

This was definitely one that I benifited from beginning early. I was not prepared to produce 700+ lines of CSS, but I feel pretty proud of it. 

I really benefited from refactoring this one. Especially on media queries. I was able to reduce the code by probably 40-50 lines because of refactoring alone. Organization really opens your eyes to some of the messier areas of your code. 

Again, I enjoy doing these and feel confident that given sole focus, I could really make a pretty good product.
